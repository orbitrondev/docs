In this section we will tell how you can get free testnet OBTTs on Orbitron Testnet for testing / building dApps:

<CardGroup>

  <Card title="Native OBTT" icon="terminal" href="#airdrop-on-native-chain">
   Native currency of Orbitron Native chain
  </Card>

  <Card title="EVM OBTT" icon="link" href="#airdrop-on-orbitron-network-evm-testnet">
   Native currency of EVM layer of Orbitron Network
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites
<CardGroup cols={1}>

  <Card title="Command Line Interface" icon="terminal" href="/quickstart">
   Orbitron CLI should be installed for claiming tokens on Native Chain
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Airdrop on Native Chain
To claim free testnet tokens on Orbitron Network Testnet Native chain

Set Orbitron Network Testnet RPC url in the Orbitron config
```bash
orbitron config set --url https:/rpc-testnet.orbitron.network
```

```bash
orbitron airdrop 10
```

You can also bridge these tokens to EVM Testnet

```bash
orbitron evm transfer-to-evm 0xf50860558A66C7cF0C5bbE44C8f2683A48C22189 10
```

## Airdrop on Orbitron Network EVM (Testnet)
You can not airdrop EVM tokens directly from Orbitron CLI but you can bridge them by requesting them on [Native Chain](#airdrop-on-native-chain)

You can use [Testnet Faucet UI](https://evm-faucet-testnet.orbitronscan.io) for claiming Testnet tokens by entering your EVM Address
