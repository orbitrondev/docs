A validator is a computer that helps to run the Orbitron Network. Each validator executes a program that keeps track of all accounts on the Orbitron Network cluster and validates transactions being added to the network. Without validators, Orbitron would not be able to function.

The more independent entities that run validators, the less vulnerable the cluster is to an attack or catastrophe that affects the cluster.

By becoming a validator, you are helping to grow the network. You are also learning firsthand how the Orbitron cluster functions at the lowest level. You will become part of an active community of operators that are passionate about the Orbitron ecosystem.

## Earning Opportunities

Validators are rewarded for their work in maintaining the network. By validating transactions and securing the network, you can earn rewards in the form of OBTT tokens. The rewards are distributed based on the amount of work your validator contributes to the network. The more you participate, the more you can earn. Additionally, validators can earn transaction fees from the transactions they validate.

## Benefits of Becoming a Validator

- **Earn Rewards:** Receive OBTT tokens and transaction fees for your efforts.
- **Gain Insight:** Understand the inner workings of the Orbitron cluster and become part of a knowledgeable community.
- **Enhance Decentralization:** Increase the number of independent entities running validators, making the network more resilient.
