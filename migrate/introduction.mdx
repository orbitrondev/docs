Here we will discuss how you can port or move your dApps from any other EVM compatible chain to Orbitron Network.

We support Solidity smart contracts, so the first step is to deploy the smart contracts on Orbitron Network, to do that you can use either of the two methods.

## Deploy from CodeBox

You can visit [CodeBox](https://remix.orbitron.network) and add your contracts there, deploy directly by connecting Metamask or orbitwallet. Make sure you have enough OBTT tokens to pay the gas fees.

## Deploy using Hardhat

You can create a Hardhat project and add [Orbitron Network Configurations](/development) depending on the network on which you want to deploy contracts. 

Once done, copy the contracts and later use them in the frontend.

## Frontend Integration

Just like other EVM chains, we support Metamask integration, so you can easily add our chain in the configurations of your frontend, add contracts deployed in previous step and Voila! You have migrated dApp from different chain to EVM in just 2 steps!
